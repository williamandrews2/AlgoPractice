# AlgoPractice

This repository contains practice implementations of common tree traversal algorithms in JavaScript. It's a simple collection of separate files for each traversal type to help reinforce understanding of tree traversal patterns.

## 📁 Files

- `preorder.js` — Pre-order tree traversal (Root → Left → Right)
- `inorder.js` — In-order tree traversal (Left → Root → Right)
- `postorder.js` — Post-order tree traversal (Left → Right → Root)
- `levelorder.js` — Level-order (Breadth-first) traversal

Each file includes a sample binary tree and a function demonstrating the traversal.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is meant for algorithm practice and understanding how different tree traversals work by writing them manually.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlgoPractice.git
   cd AlgoPractice
